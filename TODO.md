- [ ] Configure a simple transformer with torch

## Evaluation
- [ ] Compute exact-match accuracy
- [ ] Automate evaluation
- [ ] Evaluate models trained on one variety and tested on the other
- [ ] (Optional) Fine-tune a model trained on one variety for the other

## Analysis
- [ ] Summarize results in tables/plots
- [ ] Analyze data-size effects and dialectal differences
